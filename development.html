                    <h2>Twelve Pillars - Chapters 4-7 Reflection</h2>
                    
                    <div class="chapter-summary">
                        <h3>Chapter 4: The Gift of Relationships</h3>
                        <p>This chapter emphasizes how our relationships significantly impact our personal growth and success. Rohn argues that we become the average of the five people we spend the most time with, highlighting the importance of carefully choosing our associations.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application to my life:</strong> I'm intentional about maintaining relationships with both technical professionals and creative individuals. My marriage to Deneikah provides crucial support, while connections in both electrical engineering and computer science fields help me bridge these disciplines. I'll seek more mentors in the tech industry to accelerate my transition.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter-summary">
                        <h3>Chapter 5: The Gift of Learning</h3>
                        <p>Rohn discusses the importance of continuous learning and personal development. He suggests that formal education makes a living, but self-education makes a fortune, emphasizing the value of lifelong learning beyond formal schooling.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application to my life:</strong> My journey from electrician to computer science student embodies this principle. Beyond university coursework, I dedicate time to online programming tutorials, tech podcasts, and hands-on projects. I'm also learning how to apply my electrical knowledge to smart home technology development.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="chapter-summary">
                        <h3>Chapter 6: The Gift of Problems</h3>
                        <p>This chapter reframes problems as opportunities for growth. Rohn suggests that how we handle difficulties determines our success, and that solving problems is what creates value in the marketplace.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application to my life:</strong> Balancing work at AC Hotel with university studies presents scheduling challenges, but I view these as opportunities to develop superior time management skills. Complex programming concepts that initially seem daunting become chances to strengthen my problem-solving abilities, much like troubleshooting electrical systems.</p>

                    <div class="chapter-summary">
                        <h3>Chapter 7: The Gift of Attitude</h3>
                        <p>Rohn emphasizes that our attitude determines our altitude in life. He explains how maintaining a positive outlook, especially during challenges, shapes our experiences and outcomes more than any external circumstance.</p>
                        <p><strong>Application to my life:</strong> I maintain a positive attitude about my career transition, viewing it as an expansion of my capabilities rather than starting over. When facing challenging programming concepts, I remind myself that I've mastered complex electrical systems before and can do the same with computer science.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="overall-reflection">
                        <h3>Overall Reflection</h3>
                        <p>These chapters collectively emphasize that personal development is an active, intentional process. By carefully managing relationships, committing to continuous learning, embracing challenges, and maintaining a positive attitude, we can dramatically shape our life trajectory.</p>
                        <p>As I transition from electrical work to computer science, I'm applying these principles by building relationships in the tech industry, continuously updating my skills through both formal and self-education, viewing the challenges of this career change as growth opportunities, and maintaining optimism about combining my electrical expertise with software development.</p>
